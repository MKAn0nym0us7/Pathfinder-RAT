Pathfinder is a Powerful HTTP RAT FUD Backdoor Binder and web-based Application System Surveillance Monitor. It's a web-based surveillance monitor and app binder malware program developed by Mnemonic Group. Pathfinder is one of the most effective and well engineered Remote Administration Tool (RAT) program. It is the ultimate tool for mobile surveillance, to take over remote devices easily and undetected; the software creates an automated 100% FUD (Fully Undetectable) persistent backdoor designed to take full control of the devices through adding code to the legitimate apps. The backdoor, acting as a masked malicious software, gives attackers full access to perform a different actions on the target device. 

Architecture

Pathfinder RAT grants a user to control the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of any other person's device system. Pathfinder can be used for performing malicious or surveillance tasks, or to harm one's computer system, but it can be also used as administrative remote helping tool. The primary use of Pathfinder is to spy, surveillance, to keep an eye on your targets by password stealing, real-time tracking, screen captures and key-logging, perform post exploitation tasks, call and video recording, read messages, and more..

Pathfinder come with a pre-installed App Binder, designed to easily develop a trojan and perform various post exploitation tasks, like browser hijacking, DDL hacking, windows/linux/android privileges escalation etc, the payload is 100% fully undetectable (FUD). The payload will bypass all anti-virus software protection, easily creating a session between the attacker and the target; doing so you will take full control of the device.

The software consists of two parts:
1. Server side: web-based desktop application (control panel)
2. Client side: device application (backdoor) 

Infiltrator Real-Time Tracking System

The Infiltrator Real-Time Tracking System is an innovative tool for governmental and security organizations that require real-time data about sustects' location and movement. The combination of the Infiltrator Real-Time Tracking System as a strategic location solution and the Intelligence Interceptor, a tactical interception and location system, provides accurate, real-time data od target suspects and people of interest by tracking their mobile phones. The Infiltrator Real-Time Tracking System will provide the location (GPS coordination) at a Cell-ID level. The input will be the target mobile number or the IMSI and the result will show the BTS coordinator, where the target is registered on any map. 

SS7 and SIGTRAN Protocol Stacks

The SS7 and SIGTRAN protocol implementations available with their relationship to the Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model (OSI Model). Protocol suite used by most telecommunications network operators throughout the world to talk to each other.
